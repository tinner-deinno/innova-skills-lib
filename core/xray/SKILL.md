---

## Target: memory (default)

## Memory Location

```bash
ENCODED=$(pwd | sed 's|^/|-|; s|[/.]|-|g')
MEMORY_DIR="$HOME/.claude/projects/${ENCODED}/memory"
```

## Usage

```
/xray                     # Default: scan memory — list all memories with types
/xray memory              # Same as above
/xray memory scan         # Same as above
/xray memory read <name>  # Read a specific memory file
/xray memory stats        # Show counts by type, total size, age
/xray memory types        # Group memories by type
/xray memory clean        # Find stale/outdated memories
/xray memory forget <name># Archive a memory (after confirmation)
/xray skills              # List installed Oracle skills
/xray sessions            # Show session history
```

---

## Mode 1: Scan (default)

List all memory files with type, age, and description.

```bash
MEMORY_DIR="$HOME/.claude/projects/$(pwd | sed 's|^/|-|; s|[/.]|-|g')/memory"
```

Read each `.md` file (except MEMORY.md), extract frontmatter:

For each file, display:

```
🧠 Memory Scanner — [project name]

  Type        Name                              Age     Description
  ─────────── ───────────────────────────────── ─────── ────────────────────────
  feedback    never_push_main_skills            2d      Always use branch + PR
  feedback    talk_to_not_oracle_thread         9d      Use /talk-to for threads
  reference   maw_cli                           9d      maw hey, peek, ls commands
  reference   pulse_cli                         9d      board, timeline, scan
  user        work_patterns                     9d      maker's schedule, peak hours

  Total: 14 memories (5 feedback, 3 reference, 1 user, 0 project)
  Index: MEMORY.md (60 lines)
```

### How to parse

For each `.md` file in MEMORY_DIR (excluding MEMORY.md):

1. Read frontmatter between `---` markers
2. Extract `name`, `description`, `type` fields
3. Get file age from modification time: `stat -c %Y` or `date -r`
4. Format age as: `Xd` (days), `Xh` (hours), `Xm` (minutes)

Sort by type, then by age (newest first).

---

## Mode 2: Read

### `/xray memory read <name>`

Find file matching `<name>` (partial match OK):

```bash
ls "$MEMORY_DIR"/*<name>*.md | head -1
```

Display full content with frontmatter highlighted.

---

## Mode 3: Stats

### `/xray memory stats`

```
🧠 Memory Stats — [project name]

  Memories:    14 files
  Index:       MEMORY.md (60 lines)
  Total size:  12.4 KB
  Oldest:      9 days (reference_maw_cli.md)
  Newest:      2 days (feedback_never_push_main.md)

  By type:
    feedback   ████████████  5  (36%)
    reference  ████████      3  (21%)
    user       ████          1  (7%)
    project    ░░░░          0  (0%)

  Top keywords: oracle, push, maw, agent, fleet
```

### How to calculate

- Count files by type (from frontmatter)
- Sum file sizes
- Extract keywords: split all description fields into words, count frequency, show top 5

---

## Mode 4: Types

### `/xray memory types`

Group and display memories by type:

```
🧠 Memory Types

  📝 feedback (5)
    - never_push_main_skills — Always use branch + PR
    - talk_to_not_oracle_thread — Use /talk-to for threads
    - use_workon_skill — Use skill flow, don't edit directly
    - worktree_naming — worktree name = repo name
    - never_maw_done_without_approval — Ask before cleanup

  📚 reference (3)
    - maw_cli — maw hey, peek, ls commands
    - pulse_cli — board, timeline, scan
    - office_hash_routes — all views, deploy flow

  👤 user (1)
    - work_patterns — maker's schedule, peak hours

  📋 project (0)
    (none)
```

---

## Mode 5: Clean

### `/xray memory clean`

Find potentially stale memories:

1. Read each memory file
2. If `type: reference` and mentions file paths → check if files still exist
3. If `type: project` → check if still relevant (age > 30 days = likely stale)
4. Show candidates:

```
🧹 Memory Clean — candidates

  ⚠️  reference_office_hash_routes.md (9d)
      Mentions file paths — verify still current

  ✓  All other memories look current

  Run '/xray memory forget <name>' to archive a specific memory.
  Nothing is deleted — archived for history.
```

**NEVER auto-delete.** Only suggest. User decides. Stale memories are archived, not deleted.

---

## Mode 6: Forget (Archive)

### `/xray memory forget <name>`

> "Nothing is Deleted" — contradicted or stale memories are archived, not destroyed.

1. Find the file
2. Show its content
3. Ask confirmation: "Archive this memory? (yes/no)"
4. If yes:
   - Create archive dir: `mkdir -p <MEMORY_DIR>/archive/`
   - Move the file: `mv <MEMORY_DIR>/<file>.md <MEMORY_DIR>/archive/<file>.md`
   - Remove its entry from MEMORY.md
   - Confirm: "Archived: <name> → archive/<file>.md"
5. If no: "Kept: <name>"

**IMPORTANT**: Never `rm` a memory file. Always `mv` to `archive/`.

---

## Cross-Project View

If user says `/xray memory scan --all` or `/xray memory stats --all`:

```bash
ls -d "$HOME/.claude/projects"/*/memory/ 2>/dev/null
```

Show memory counts per project:

```
🧠 All Projects

  Project                          Memories  Size
  ──────────────────────────────── ──────── ──────
  neo-oracle                       14        12.4KB
  arra-oracle-skills-cli                 8         6.2KB
  maw-js                            5         3.1KB
  office-8bit                       3         2.0KB

  Total: 30 memories across 4 projects
```

---

## Target: skills

### `/xray skills`

List all installed Oracle skills with their profiles and status.

```bash
arra-oracle-skills list -g
```

Display:

```
🔬 Installed Skills

  Skill                Profile     Status
  ──────────────────── ─────────── ──────
  forward              seed        ✓ installed
  retrospective        seed        ✓ installed
  rrr                  seed        ✓ installed
  awaken               standard    ✓ installed
  trace                standard    ✓ installed
  learn                standard    ✓ installed

  Total: N skills installed
  Profile: [seed|standard|full]
```

### How to gather

1. Run `arra-oracle-skills list -g` to get installed skills
2. Cross-reference with profiles from `profiles.ts`
3. Show which profile each skill belongs to

---

## Target: sessions

### `/xray sessions`

Show recent Claude Code session history and retrospectives.

1. Look for retrospectives in `ψ/memory/retrospectives/`
2. Look for session logs in `ψ/memory/logs/`
3. Display recent sessions with dates and summaries:

```
📜 Session History

  Date         Duration  Summary
  ──────────── ──────── ────────────────────────────────
  2026-03-25   45min     Built xray skill, updated profiles
  2026-03-24   30min     Fixed awaken language picker
  2026-03-23   1h20min   Refactored profiles system

  Total: N sessions found
  Source: ψ/memory/retrospectives/
```

### How to gather

1. Read files in `ψ/memory/retrospectives/` sorted by date (newest first)
2. Extract date, duration, and summary from each retrospective
3. If no retrospectives exist, check `ψ/memory/logs/` for session snapshots
4. Show "No session history found" if both are empty
