Route to the appropriate exploration / capture skill based on the user's intent.
`gsd-note`, `gsd-add-todo`, `gsd-add-backlog`, and `gsd-plant-seed` were folded
into `gsd-capture` (with `--note`, default, `--backlog`, `--seed` modes) by
#2790. The capture target lists pending todos via `--list`.

| User wants | Invoke |
